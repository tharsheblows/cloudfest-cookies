### first vs third party cookies

**First party cookies** are stored by the domain (website) you are visiting directly.
They allow website owners to collect analytics data, remember language settings, and perform other useful functions that
help provide a good user experience.

**Third party cookies** are created by domains other than the one you are visiting directly, hence the name third-party.
They are used for cross-site tracking, retargeting and ad-serving.

Technically speaking, first- and third-party cookies are the same type of files. What’s different is how they are created and used by websites.
