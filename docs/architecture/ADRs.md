## Architecture Decision Log (ADL)
### ADR-1: Hackathon Scope
* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Hackathon Team
* Date: 2023-02-18 13:15

Technical Story: none

#### Context
There are multiple ways to create awareness for the upcoming changes for 3rd party cookies caused by the EU ePrivacy Directive 2022.
We have to decide on a way that is achievable during the Cloudfest Hackathon and providing value for technical and non-technical users.

#### Considered Options
* Browser Plugin
* Library
* CLI

#### Decision
Implementation of a browser plugin for Google Chrome.

#### Consequences
First increment will use the Google Chrome API.
This allows for a fast MVP, but makes the solution platform specific. 
  

#### Notes / Links
